Hi! I'm Aluc! I'm a Brazilian student that really likes programming. My main programming language is Python, but I can also code in C++ and C#. I could learn any programming language in a short ammount of time if needed (I learned C# in a week because I needed to make a game in unity). I am also really interested in indie game development.
I've been coding/programming for about 1.5 years now!
